What's up, fellas?

What is the most famous way to start your own blog? To tell ya once again how I created it! :D

For real, I thought that it will be much more easier, but my first attempt was with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). Why? Because of modern technologies, yeah! React, GraphQL, etc. But the amount of node packages (more than 1k, lol) and some security issues with dependenices forced me to find something else. Right now I'm trying to invest my time into JavaScript, so, my next attemp was with [Hugo.js](https://gohugo.io). It was pretty ok, but then Hugo ecosystem just killed me with it's complexity. Maybe I'm dumb, but, for real, I just want to have a static blog hosted on Github Pages, I don't want to spend hours and hours just configuring it.

Then I decided to give [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) a shot aaand it was perfect for me! Configuration is almost no-brainer, huge amount of themes (even paid themes, lol) and, the most important, I can be focused on content creation, rather than spending days for configuration. The only thing I want to invest time in is handy `Rakefile`. Right now, there are just 2 commands: create new post and run Jekyll locally, but I want to have a scripts to publish posts, rollback posts, change topics/tags, etc. It's just a matter of time, but, anyways, Jekyll is great instrument, props to Jekyll team ❤️.

Basically, this is it from me, it's enough for the first ever post from me. I hope, that I will publish new posts periodically, at least one post per 2 weeks (I will try to do it more often, I promise).

Check ya later, feel free to ping me anywhere you want.
