I'm kinda talented, more than 5-years experienced Software Engineer. At the moment, the most part of my experience is mobile development (iOS, both native and cross-platform with Xamarin). I participated in all stages of application development process from discussing requirements with customer to submitting into store. However, I'm not just a mobile developer: I have pretty solid technical background in computer science (Master's Degree, yay!). I'm very interested in designing complex systems, functional programming and generally in programming.

I hope, that this blog will help me to structurize my own thoughts about different topics. I will try to use English for the majoority of posts, but sometimes (sorry for that) they will be in Russian, just because topic will be strongly related to Russian-speaking audience only.
